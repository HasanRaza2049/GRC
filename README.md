This repository contains my Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) related projects, created to demonstrate practical understanding of risk management, control design, compliance alignment, and audit-ready documentation.

Current contents include:

Access Management SOP aligned with ISO/IEC 27001, NIST SP 800-53, SOC 2, and SBP Cybersecurity Framework

Sample Risk Register with impact, likelihood, risk treatment, and control mapping

Information Assurance case study focusing on cloud misconfiguration, data governance, threat modeling, and remediation

This repository serves as a growing GRC portfolio and may be expanded over time with additional governance, risk, and compliance–related artifacts as part of ongoing learning and professional development.
